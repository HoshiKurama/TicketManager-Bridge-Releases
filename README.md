# TicketManager: Proxy Bridge Edition

TM:PBE expands the TicketManager ecosystem to Minecraft networks, enabling cross-server teleportation and notifications on servers connected by a proxy.

### Notes
- TM:PBE is functionally a relay for TM:SE. Thus, TM:SE requirements on each server are unaltered.
- Verify compatibility between TM:SE and TM:PBE on the [Ecosystem and Compatibility](https://github.com/HoshiKurama/TicketManager/wiki/Ecosystem-and-Compatibility) wiki page.
- Currently, all TM:PBE code is in the [primary TicketManager repository](https://github.com/HoshiKurama/TicketManager).
